Code Refactor Challenge

This is a challenge about refactoring a code in order to make the webpage accessible and improve SEO. I have added semantic HTML elements, corrected the links so it becomes operative, added comments and accessible alt attributes. Furthermore, I made changes to the CSS file by combining its structure with the HTML file so it follows the semantic structure of the HTML elements, added comments, and organized the CSS selectors.
